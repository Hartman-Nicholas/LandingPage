            Do politely ask us questions and let us know what you like and don’t
            like about a specific post, or the ideas talked about in it.

            Don’t be a jerk, call people jerks, or react to jerks. We’ll remove
            bad stuff when we see it.

            Spam: Zero tolerance, of course! If it comes from a human or a
            robot, spam will be deleted. This includes self-promotion. Generally
            speaking, promoting your projects here will be treated like any
            other spam.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            Personal attacks: Don’t attack or insult another user. It’s not
            helpful and it doesn’t make Landing Page a friendly place. This
            includes calling other members trolls.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            Doxxing: Don’t reveal someone else’s personal information.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            Illegal activities: Posting links to illegal downloads, ways to
            steal service, and other nefarious activity is not OK here.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            NSFW material: Nope, not allowed. Even images or links that could be
            considered borderline are not acceptable. A good rule of thumb is
            that anything beyond PG-13 will get you in trouble, but we reserve
            the right to remove any post we deem offensive. This goes for
            pornographic material, vile language, gore and generally gross
            stuff.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            Racism, sexism, and other discrimination: Attacking entire classes
            of people is just like attacking a single person: we’ll ban you for
            it.
          </li>
          <li className="homePage__list--item">
            Trolling: ”Trolling” is a big, messy term, but we know what trolls
            are and we won’t tolerate it. If you’re abusing the good
            conversations here at Landing Page, we will take your comments and
            posts down. This includes taking a thread off-topic, by the way.
